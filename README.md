# Pokemon Pokedex

A detailed Pokemon pokedex which will show a Pokemon's abilities, stats and evolution.

### Project Description

A responsive project made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Utilizing React, React-Router-Dom, React-Redux, Redux-Toolkit, Axios.

### How to run

This project was made using create-react-app. You will need to run it on your localhost using npm start.

### Misc Info

I wanted to make a project to practice API calls and data handling. PokeAPI.co allows free unlimited calls and therefore it was a great choice to use for this reason as I am trying to understand the different ways to fetch data.

I also decided to use Redux (Redux toolkit to be more precise) as I really enjoyed using it for my last project. Ofcourse, useState would have been sufficient for a small scale project such as this Pokedex, but I wanted to get more practice in using Redux.

Throughout the project I have faced many problems such as the difficulty that is in handling complex JSON data and infinitely fetching API (Lucky the API was free!) by putting a fetch request straight inside a useEffect. Regarding the fetching, I have learn to create an async function outside the useEffect before calling the function inside and regarding data handling, I have since learned how useful Regex and recursive functions can be.

Overall, I am extremely happy with what I have made. Not only from looking at the end result, but by what I have managed to learn in the process.
